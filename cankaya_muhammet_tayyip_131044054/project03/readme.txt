- Instructions that you have to implement: sw, lw, beq, j, add, andi, slt, slti

- Top Level Design File: mips_core
- You can not use behavioral verilog in mips_core. You, however, allowed to use "assign".

- Testbench File: mips_testbench

- mips_registers.v is register module
- registers.mem for initialization of registers

- mips_instr_mem.v is instruction memory module
- instruction.mem for instruction memory initialization

- mips_data_mem.v is data memory module
- data.mem for data memory initialization
